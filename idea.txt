More post karma vs. comment karma? *
Need to go deeper?
	- Are the comments really short? Do they contain lots of duplicates? Bot flags flyin', nigga.


* Time! How old is the account? Try to draw a sort of timeline and measure hotspots or something.
    - How would the timeline look if you wrote a bot for harvesting karma?

---

* Grab the top posts from /r/all
* Iterate their OPs
* Gather a list of "suspects"
* Write it down
* Do this once a day or something, with a manual check
* Manually "judge" each OP
* Publish the list somewhere as a static JSON, perhaps?
* Write an extension that uses this data and marks/removes spammy posts for the user
